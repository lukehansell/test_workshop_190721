Checkout out the accompanying [slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/17KRwj-d9uAoaNA8S5KnvHW2s_jsLJOCzFhDTJJK_VR8/edit?usp=sharing)

Work through the slides, using the tests in the `tests/` directory as examples. Some examples will need modifying to get them to run properly.

To run a test, remember you can use `npm mocha path/to/test/file.js`
